A engine for the super tictactoe game (a tictactoe game composed of 9 smaller games if you win the small game you place your symbol in the larger one and who win the larger one wins (you need to place your symbol in the supersquare in the larger one coresponding to the subsquare of the last placed symbol (if that square is already won or no symbols placed in whole grid you can choose))).
The engine is still in construction but its wanted to let it use minimax.
